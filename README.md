#Nafuu Chain Stores
This project was written in react, tailwind and to a minimal degree, ant design components(3 of them).
Install normally to get a list of the dependencies
                    : npm install
#Backend Mockup
This project will run on JSON-Server, which will not need much effort to quickly start
Open a second terminal and use
                    : npx json-server --host 192.168.2.152 public/db.json --port 5000
This will allow you to access the app with other devices in your network, not only the localhost.
